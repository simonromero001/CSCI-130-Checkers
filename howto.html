    <h1>How to play</h1>
    <div></div>
    <b>STEP 1</b>
    <p>
    <ol>Start the game if you’re the player with black checkers.</ol>
    <ol>You can only move one checker one diagonal space forward (toward your opponent’s checkers) during a regular turn.</ol>
    <ol>Checkers must stay on the dark squares. Once the player with black checkers makes their first move, the player with white checkers moves, and then you’ll take turns</ol>
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <b>STEP 2</b>
    <p> 
        Jump your opponent's checkers to remove them from the board. If your checker is in the diagonal space nearest to one of your opponent's checkers, then you can jump and capture that checker. To capture a checker, move two diagonal spaces in the direction of the checker you’re attacking, like you are hopping over your opponent's piece.

        <ol>The space on the other side of your opponent’s checker has to be empty so that you can move into it.</ol>
        <ol>If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker, then the rules state you must jump it.</ol>
        <ol>If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker in multiple parts of the board, then you can choose which checkers you'd like to jump.</ol>
        <ol>If the new position you land in gives you a direct opportunity to capture another checker, then you must keep going until you can't capture any more of your opponent's checkers.</ol>
    
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <b>STEP 3</b>
    <p> King your pieces when your checkers reach the end of your opponent's side. To crown a checker and make it a king checker, simply place one of your own captured pieces on top of it. The king can move forward and backward diagonally on the dark squares, so it's easier for king checkers to capture your opponent's checkers.

        <ol>Kings can still only move one diagonal space at a time during a non-capture move. However, when a king is capturing checkers, it can move forward and backward on the same turn.</ol>
        <ol>This would apply only if a king were doing a capture move that required it to change directions, such as if two checkers were lined up next to each other on dark squares in a horizontal line. To capture these checkers, the king would have to jump forwards and then backwards.</ol>
        <ol>Some checkers sets have a crown on the back of the checkers, so you can just flip a piece over once it is crowned to designate it as the king.</ol>
        <ol>There is no limit to how many crowned pieces you can have.
    
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <br>
    <b>STEP 4</b>
    <p> Keep jumping and capturing to win the game. Continue jumping and capturing your opponent's checkers until they are all removed from the board. Once you have captured all of your opponent’s checkers, you have won the game!
        <ol>A less common way to win is when all of your opponent's pieces are blocked so that your opponent can't make any more moves.</ol>   
    </p>
